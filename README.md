## Abstract
* Segments of code from my first course in R
## Contributor
* Zachary Vallery
## Goal
* My goal is to develop a good foundation in R before deciding if I want to go into more complex courses in python, R, or just take on my own project.  
## Reflection
* Upon completion of this course, I have decided that I want to do a couple of python courses on data camp and then delve into a project.  By November 9th, I hope to have two more courses completed in Data Camp and be ready to start a project to supplememnt contiunuing data camp.
